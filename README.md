# Hacker Couch

**Pledge your couch to hackers!**

1. Fork this repository and put in your couch and/or travel info.
2. Manually add "Issues" to your fork by clicking the "Admin" tab in your fork.
3. Other hackers can [search](https://github.com/search?q=hackercouch+berlin) to find your info.
4. To request a stay or invite fellow hackers, open an issue in the tracker.

It’s like CouchSurfing, except CouchSurfing sucks. So does AirBnB, hostels and hotels. Why not stay with fellow hackers when traveling?


## Crash my couch
I have no permanent couch at the moment. But if I would, I’d say something like this:

* couch in Berlin-Kreuzberg, near cool spots like betahaus and c-base

No need to limit length of stay or state interests, just check out people’s profiles, look at their code and discuss everything directly in the issue.


## Have me crash your couch
Your next travels where you need a couch go in here, like:

* October 29 – November 8 in Berlin
* November 8 – November 12 in Gothenburg (for [FSCONS](https://fscons.org/2012/))
